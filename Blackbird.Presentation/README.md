# Presentation Layer

ASP.NET Core MVC (Model-View-Controller) can be considered to be the presentation layer. 

It can be a physical layer (uses application via HTTP APIs) or a logical layer (directly injects and uses application services). 

In either case it can include Localization, Navigation, Object Mapping, Caching, Configuration Management, Audit Logging and so on. 

It also deals with Authorization, Session, Features (for multi-tenant applications) and Exception Handling.
