# Domain Entities

Entities are one of the core concepts of DDD (Domain Driven Design). 

Eric Evans describe it as **"An object that is not fundamentally defined by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and identity".**

Essentially, entities have Id's and are stored in a database. 

An entity is generally mapped to a table in a relational database.
