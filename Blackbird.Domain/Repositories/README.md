# Repositories Implementation

The repository pattern **"Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects"** (Martin Fowler).

Repositories, in practice, are used to perform database operations for domain objects (Entity and Value types). 

Generally, a separate repository is used for each Entity (or Aggregate Root).
